# Going Medieval Console Mod
*The auto bug report feature has been stripped from this assembly so the devs don't get spammed with any errors that may not exist in the actual game. If you encounter actual issues they will not be sent off to the devs.*

This mod makes it so clicking the "report bugs or send feedback" button opens the developer console instead of the regular menu.
The mod is currently built off of game **v0.5.28.6**, if this isn't the version that your client is running then I recommend you don't try to use this. Tag ***@cabbagegod#6600*** on Discord if you really want this mod updated.

## How to install (Steam)

Installing this mod is very simple but before you continue ensure that a version of the mod exists for the version of the game you are running. If you try installing the mod with mismatched versions you are very likely to break the game. *This tutorial is made for Steam users, if you bought the game off another platform you'll have to figure it out yourself although it should be the same idea.*
1. First open your steam library and navigate to the Going Medieval page.
2. Then on the top right of the page just under the banner look for the gear called "Manage," click it and select "Properties".
3. Now select "LOCAL FILES"
4. Hit "Browse..." to open your file explorer, navigating to "Going Medieval_Data" -> "Managed"
5. Download the [release](https://github.com/cabbagegod/going-medieval-devconsole-mod/releases) for your version of the game and drag it into the folder you just opened, ensuring that it overwrites the old file.
*You can check the main lobby to make sure you are running the mod.*
